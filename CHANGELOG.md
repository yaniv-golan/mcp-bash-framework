# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Align MCP capability advertising with spec (`completion` key, remove off-spec `roots`; stop advertising resource templates until implemented).
- Fix elicitation support wiring (propagate worker key to tools; SDK choice helper uses negotiated JSON tool).
- Documentation cleanup (SPEC-COMPLIANCE, registry hash fallback, best-practices references, root SECURITY.md link).
