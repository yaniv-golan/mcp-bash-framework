# Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors and users to:
- Be respectful and inclusive; harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks are not tolerated.
- Focus feedback on the code and ideas, not individuals.
- Assume good intent and seek clarification before escalating.
- Follow project security practices when handling reports or sensitive data.

If you observe behavior that violates these principles, email the maintainers (see `docs/SECURITY.md`) or open a private channel for moderation.
