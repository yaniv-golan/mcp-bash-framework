# __NAME__ Resource Scaffold

Generated by `bin/mcp-bash scaffold resource __NAME__`.

- `__NAME__.txt` contains the backing file served through the `file` provider.
- `__NAME__.meta.json` registers the resource with a `file://` URI pointing at the generated file.

Edit the file content or update the metadata to point at a different provider/URI as needed. After updating, run `test/integration/test_resources.sh` to verify list/read behaviour.
