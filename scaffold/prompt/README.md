# __NAME__ Prompt Scaffold

Generated by `bin/mcp-bash scaffold prompt __NAME__`.

- `__NAME__.txt` is the prompt template. Use shell-compatible `${variable}` tokens and any surrounding narrative.
- `__NAME__.meta.yaml` registers the prompt, including argument definitions so clients know which parameters are expected, per Spec §10.

After editing the template, run your MCP server and call `prompts/get` with sample arguments to confirm rendering (see `test/integration/test_prompts.sh`).
