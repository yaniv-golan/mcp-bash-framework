# __NAME__ Tool Scaffold

This directory was generated by `bin/mcp-bash scaffold tool __NAME__`.

Key files:

- `__NAME__.sh` sources `${MCP_SDK}/tool-sdk.sh` so you can call helpers like `mcp_args_get`, `mcp_emit_json`, `mcp_progress`, and `mcp_log`.
- `__NAME__.meta.json` advertises arguments and an `outputSchema` so clients receive both structured and text responses, per protocol spec.

Next steps:

1. Implement your tool logic inside `__NAME__.sh`, replacing the greeting with real behaviour.
2. Adjust `__NAME__.meta.json` to document any required arguments, timeouts, or structured output.
3. Check out `examples/02-logging-and-levels` and `examples/03-progress-and-cancellation` for patterns that build on the SDK helpers.

Run `mcp-bash` after editing to ensure the tool loads and passes the integration tests under `test/integration/test_tools.sh`.
